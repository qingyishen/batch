Two internal commands were re-"discovered" here:

KEYS and DPATH


DPATH help message points to APPEND command and is not useful at all.
It's syntax is the same as PATH command.Later Carlos Mortinez discovered that
TYPE command uses %DPATH% variable set by DPATH command and can print files in DPATH 
directories like there in the same directory.The same with input redirection:

KEYS command message also is missleading - it claims that has no effect but sets a %KEYS% vaiable (ON or OFF) 
despite the command itself does not rely on the environment variable to check its status.
