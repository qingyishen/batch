demonstrates the effects of keys command.
I've mentioned the command here http://ss64.org/viewtopic.php?id=1558
and later in the thread Dave Benham discovered that the command sets an environemnt
variable , which means that the help message is wrong - it  affects the current console.
Keys does not relly on %keys% variable to display its state correctly
